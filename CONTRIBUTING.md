### Local Development

1. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/choreo-fullstack-sample.git
   cd choreo-fullstack-sample
   ```

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start development servers**
   ```bash

## üìù Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- **Write clear, readable code** with meaningful variable and function names
- **Add comments** for complex logic or business rules
- **Follow existing patterns** and conventions in the codebase
- **Keep functions small** and focused on a single responsibility
- **Use TypeScript** for type safety where applicable

### Backend (Node.js)

- **Use ES6+ features** consistently
- **Follow RESTful API conventions** for endpoints
- **Implement proper error handling** with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Add JSDoc comments** for functions and classes
- **Use async/await** instead of callbacks or raw promises
- **Validate input data** using Joi or similar libraries

### Frontend (Next.js/React)

- **Use functional components** with hooks
- **Follow React best practices** for state management
- **Use TypeScript interfaces** for props and state
- **Implement proper error boundaries** and loading states
- **Follow accessibility guidelines** (WCAG 2.1)
- **Use semantic HTML** elements where appropriate

### CSS/Styling

- **Use Tailwind CSS** utility classes consistently
- **Follow mobile-first** responsive design principles
- **Maintain consistent spacing** and typography
- **Use CSS custom properties** for theme values
- **Avoid inline styles** except for dynamic values

## üß™ Testing

### Backend Testing

```bash
cd backend
npm test                # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # Generate coverage report
```

### Frontend Testing

```bash
cd frontend
npm test                # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:e2e        # Run end-to-end tests
```

### Test Guidelines

- **Write unit tests** for utility functions and business logic
- **Write integration tests** for API endpoints
- **Write component tests** for React components
- **Aim for high test coverage** (>80%)
